# Stream C: Configuration & Settings

## Scope
Add configuration for SegFormer service URL and related settings

## Files
- app/config.py (already configured)

## Progress
- ✅ Configuration already present

## Completed
Config.py already had:
- segformer_service_url: Defaults to "http://140.96.77.124:8080/"
- segformer_timeout: Defaults to 300 seconds
- Both configurable via environment variables

No changes needed - configuration was already implemented in a previous task.
